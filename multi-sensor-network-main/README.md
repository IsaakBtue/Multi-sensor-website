# Multi-sensor Network (CBL)

This repository contains the codebase for a multi-sensor network project using ESP32 development boards. The project supports two primary environments:

- **Station**: Sensor nodes with dedicated sensor modules.
- **Gateway**: Access points/gateways interfacing with Wi-Fi, BMS, and or serving the user web interface.

The structure can be expanded later according to our needs.

## Project Structure

The project is organized using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) in VSCode, which simplifies managing multiple boards and build environments. However, you can also use the Arduino IDE if preferred.

- `src/` — Source code for the active environment (filtered by `platformio.ini`).
- `lib/` — Local libraries or custom-modified dependencies.
- `include/` — Shared header files.
- `data/` — Static assets like HTML, CSS, JS for the web interface served by gateways.
- `platformio.ini` — Build configuration with multiple environments (station, gateway).

## Getting Started

To get up and running:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open it in VSCode with the PlatformIO extension installed (optional but recommended).
3. Choose your build environment (`station` or `gateway`) in `platformio.ini`.
4. Edit source files in the respective folders (`src/station/` or `src/gateway/`).
5. Use PlatformIO commands to build, upload, and monitor your ESP32 devices.

If you prefer Arduino IDE, you can open the relevant `.ino` files in the `src/` folder and compile/upload manually.
